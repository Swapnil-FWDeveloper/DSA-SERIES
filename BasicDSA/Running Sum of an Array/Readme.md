Hint

In the sample test case, the array has 5 elements. For each element, we have to find the sum of all the elements that exist before it, and include the current element as well

Therefore, for all the elements, the sum becomes

index - 0->{1 = 1}

index - 1->{1 + 2 = 3}

index - 2->{1 + 2 + 3 = 6}

index - 3->{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10}

index - 4->{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15}
